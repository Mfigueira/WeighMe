# WeighMe App

## What is this?
This is WeighMe! A Web -Mobile Styled- Application to help you keep tracking of your weight over time.
I developed it as my 'CS50's Introduction to Computer Science' Final Project.
Inspired in solving some of my parents problems with tracking their weights.

Here's a short video [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1dwkZt882o).
	
## Technologies
Project stack:
* Backend/API: Python with Flask
* DB: PostgreSQL
* Frontend: React and Material-UI
* Deployment: Heroku

## How does it work?
The App is simple:
* Create a NEW USER or sign in with an existing one
* In the SCALE tab add your weight and the time of the weighing
* In the GRID tab you can see by filters, update, delete, and even export your weighings
* And in the CHART tab you can see a Graph with your weight over time

All of your weighings are persistently stored in a database

## OK Great! Can I see it? Can I use it??
OF COURSE! Here's the link to the app: [WeighMe](https://weighme.herokuapp.com/).

Enjoy your Weighings!
